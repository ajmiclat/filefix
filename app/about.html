        <h1>Vision</h1>
        <p>We are committed to be a humble partner in nation building by indirectly upgrading the quality of public service in the government; a task attainable by way of an effective efficient, and well-protected filing of various unattended vital documents in government agencies.</p>
        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <p>In pursuit of excellence, we are committed,</p>
        <p>1.	To deliver durable filing and binding materials expertly manufactured to withstand the rigors of elements through time;</p>
        <p>2.	To cater the requirements for unique dimensions and specifications, distinctly suited to every customer need.</p>
        <p>3.	To sustain and endeavor to elevate our presence in the industry through constant sensitivity to the indigence of the market.</p>
        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>FILEFIX PHILIPPINES started with a vision on March 8, 1992.</p>
        <p>Manny S. Bacoto, founder of Filefix Philippines, was then serving as a government auditor. That day, he realized he badly needed a sturdy filing material for all the voluminous documents submitted to him by the agency accountant for audit.</p>
        <p>With this, he took a pen and drew the concept of how a document filer must be, as he envisioned it. He immediately brought the sketch to a friend of his, Boning Ho, to help him concretize the drawing. The following day, Boning handed Manny the first prototype of the filer. And that was what started it all.</p>
        <p>BOMAN’s INDUSTRIES (coined after Manny and Boning) was created and registered under “Kalakalan 20” program of the government in the name of the founder’s brother, Jojo Bacoto. A humble office and factory had to be the old and small house of Manny and wife Emily. They were barely able to raise a 20-thousand peso starting capitalization due to financing constraints. After a year of toil, the company began supplying its filing products through out the city of Tacloban. It was operating with 5 people in production and a few others doing the selling work. In the middle of the second year, Emily decided to assist in the marketing work. She realized the potential of the company when her selling yielded the first big purchase order amounting to 300,000 pesos for that humble yet fruitful year.</p>
        <p>By 1994, BOMAN’S INDUSTRIES was already doing business throughout Region 8. It proceeded with its expansion by the middle of the year. BOMAN’S INDUSTRIES was also changed into FILEFIX PHILIPPINES; this time registered under Emily S. Bacoto.</p>
        <p>Today, FILEFIX PHILIPPINES manufactures its products in a 2000 square meter lot in Lipa City, Batangas. It operates with an output of 7000 units finished product per day, capable of providing customers’ needs for the whole of Luzon area. Its expansion program has now reached Regions 1 to 5, and some areas in Mindanao and in the Visayas.</p>
        <p>Apart from all the standard record storage and filing needs, we care to provide requirements when others cannot deliver orders of filers with sizes and specifications not normally available in the market. Our customer representatives are always ready for consultation regarding special made to order requests.</p>
        <p>Our pricing policy in the procurement process and delivery terms are in line with regulations as mandated by the Government Procurement Act of 2002, as implemented by the Procurement Service thru its online PhilGEPS portal. Filefix Philippines Inc. has always been a registered merchant of good standing with the Philippine Procurement Service Office since 2003.</p>
        <p>The vision that started years ago has now turned into a vivid reality.</p>
